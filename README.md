# Flower Classification Neural Network

This project implements a neural network in Go for classifying types of iris flowers based on their features. It uses a dataset of flower images to train the model.

## Prerequisites

Before running the neural network, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Go 
- TODO: add more dependencies

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

<code>git clone https://github.com/dedbin/nn_go_scratch.git</code>


## Usage

To train and test the neural network, run the following command:
<code>go run main.go train</code>
To classify a new flower image, use the following command:

<code>go run main.go classify</code>

and then input file path 
TODO: create file dialog to choose file

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! If you would like to contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine:

<code>git clone https://github.com/dedbin/nn_go_scratch.git</code>


2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

<code>git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name</code>


3. Make your changes and commit them with descriptive commit messages:

<code>git commit -m "Add new feature: your feature name"</code>
